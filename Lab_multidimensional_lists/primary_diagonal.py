'''Write a program that finds the sum of all numbers in a matrix's primary diagonal (runs from top left to bottom right). On the first line, 
you will receive an integer N â€“ the size of a square matrix. 
The next N lines holds the values for each column - N numbers, separated by a single space. '''
